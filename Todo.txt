binary dump range

refactoring
	type instead for IS_COMMENT, IS_BITFIELD, IS_SKIP
	split should use $self->{FIELD_LENGTH}
	author tests

handle bit zero on left

examples
	IPV4 header
	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-record

		
Data::hexDump::Table
	see IPV4 example on wikipedia

Test::Hexdump::Range
	alway use ANSI or ascii. or direct to file and accept any format
	not user settable color (we cycle)
	different bytes are displayed with red background
		how do we tell DHR to change the color of only a few bytes within a range
			./Build ; perl -Mblib scripts/hdr Todo.txt  -r 'header,40, yellow:padding,16:magic,16,red:size,4:data,10:data_got,10,on_red:data,80:footer,16'
			./Build ; perl -Mblib scripts/hdr Todo.txt  -r 'header,40, yellow:padding,16:magic,16,red:size,4:data,10:data_exp,10,black on_green:data,80:footer,16'

	cyclic colors must contain OK and error colors
	user settable number of ranges to dispay after and before the diff in the binary data
	side by side comparizon
