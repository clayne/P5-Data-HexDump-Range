MSB/LSB
	shouldn't we use b* when bit 0 is on the right

refactoring
	do not cary the data in the ranges
	type instead for IS_COMMENT, IS_BITFIELD, IS_SKIP
	split should use $self->{FIELD_LENGTH}
	author tests
	spelling
	skip range code
	bitfield column display code
		cleaner
		more effective
	data flow and architectural overview
